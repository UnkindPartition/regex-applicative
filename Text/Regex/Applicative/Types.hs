-- | Type of regular expressions that recognize symbols of type @s@ and
-- produce a result of type @a@.
--
-- Regular expressions can be built using 'Functor', 'Applicative',
-- 'Alternative', and 'Monoid' instances in the following natural way:
--
-- * @f@ '<$>' @ra@ matches iff @ra@ matches, and its return value is the result
-- of applying @f@ to the return value of @ra@.
--
-- * 'pure' @x@ matches the empty string (i.e. it does not consume any symbols),
-- and its return value is @x@
--
-- * @rf@ '<*>' @ra@ matches a string iff it is a concatenation of two
-- strings: one matched by @rf@ and the other matched by @ra@. The return value
-- is @f a@, where @f@ and @a@ are the return values of @rf@ and @ra@
-- respectively.
--
-- * @ra@ '<|>' @rb@ matches a string which is accepted by either @ra@ or @rb@.
-- It is left-biased, so if both can match, the result of @ra@ is used.
--
-- * 'empty' is a regular expression which does not match any string.
--
-- * 'many' @ra@ matches concatenation of zero or more strings matched by @ra@
-- and returns the list of @ra@'s return values on those strings.
--
-- * 'some' @ra@ matches concatenation of one or more strings matched by @ra@
-- and returns the list of @ra@'s return values on those strings.
--
-- * @ra@ '<>' @rb@ matches a string iff it is a concatenation of two
-- strings: one matched by @ra@ and the other matched by @rb@. The return value
-- is @a <> b@, where @a@ and @b@ are the return values of @ra@ and @rb@
-- respectively.
