# Contributing guidelines

Bug reports are always welcome. Please provide full instructions to reproduce.

Pull requests fixing bugs are much appreciated.

Feature requests (whether in the form of an issue or a pull request) are
acceptable only if:

1. The feature would be useful for a large fraction of users, as opposed to
   tackling an uncommon use case.
2. When filing a feature request as an issue, if it's accepted, you are willing
   to implement it.

When creating a pull request, please read and follow [How to prepare a good pull request](https://ro-che.info/articles/2016-09-18-good-pull-requests).

Issues asking questions are fine, assuming you've put a reasonable effort to
figure out the answer yourself first.
